This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
After you have navigated to the directory you wish to clone this project to, type the following git command in the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/movo608/ane-collection.git
```

The next step is to install the dependencies present in package.json.

```bash
npx install --save
# or
npm install --save
```

Afterwards, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

There is an image upload component which requires a system path in order to work. It should be edited with an equivalent to your local system's filepath to ensure it works.

Edit the following line inside `pages/api/admin/image-upload.js`:
```code
// must be changed on every local device
const newPath = '/your/system/path/public/uploads/' + fileName
```

The database configuration is present inside `lib/db.js`, a file which you must create as such:

```code

import mysql from 'serverless-mysql'

const db = mysql({
    config: {
        host: 'yourHost.com',
        port: 'port', //int
        database: 'database_name',
        user: 'username',
        password: 'password'
    }
})

export default async function executeQuery({ query, values }) {
    try {
        const results = await db.query(query, values)
        await db.end()

        return results
    } catch (error) {
        return { error }
    }
}
```

The mailing system configuration is present inside `components/checkout/Mailing.js`, a file which you must create as such:

```code

const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')

export const sendMail = async (to, subject, text, attachment) => {
    const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
        service: 'Gmail',
        host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
        port: '465',
        auth: {
            user: 'username',
            pass: 'password'
        }
    })

    try {
        const info = await transporter.sendMail({
            from: 'your@email.com',
            to: 'to@someone.com',
            subject: 'Subject',
            text: 'Some lorem Ipsum!',
            attachments: [{
                path: `/local/path/to/attachments/${attachment}`
            }]
        })

        console.log(`Message sent: ${info.messageId}`)
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err)
    }
}
```

The Stripe Payment must be configured as such:

Inside `/components/cart/stepper/index.js`:

```code
const stripePromise = loadStripe('PUBLIC_KEY')
```

Inside `/api/checkout/create-session.js`:

```code
const stripe = require('stripe')('SECRET_API_KEY')
```
